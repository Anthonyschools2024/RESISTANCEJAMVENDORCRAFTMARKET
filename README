Resistance Jam: Vendor & Craft Market Application PageüöÄ Project OverviewThis project is a single-page, fully responsive microsite designed as an application portal for vendors, merchants, and artisans wanting to participate in the "Resistance Jam" event. It's a clone of the original "Battle of the Bands" sign-up page, repurposed specifically for vendor applications.The design maintains the Star Wars Rebel Alliance theme to create a cohesive and immersive experience across all event-related materials. The entire webpage is self-contained in a single index.html file for maximum portability and ease of deployment.‚ú® Key FeaturesThematic Design: A dark, space-themed background with Rebel Alliance colors (orange, yellow) and iconography. Uses the "Orbitron" and "Roboto" Google Fonts for a distinct sci-fi aesthetic.Vendor-Focused Content: All text has been rewritten to address merchants. It clearly outlines the opportunity and states the $35 vendor fee, framed thematically as a contribution to the cause.Responsive Layout: Built with Tailwind CSS, the application page is optimized for all devices, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.Functional Application Form: A clean form tailored for vendors to submit their details:Vendor/Shop NameEmailPhone NumberA large text area for Vendor Details & Wares, prompting for product descriptions, shop links, and special requirements (e.g., power).Asynchronous Form Submission: Uses JavaScript's fetch API to submit form data to Formspree without a page reload. This provides a modern user experience with instant on-page feedback for success or errors.Single-File Deployment: All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are bundled into one file, making it incredibly simple to host.üõ†Ô∏è Tech StackHTML5: For the core structure and content.Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used via a CDN for styling and responsiveness.Custom CSS: Embedded within <style> tags for the background, fonts, and specific thematic styles.JavaScript (ES6): For handling the form submission to the backend service.Formspree: Used as the serverless backend to capture form submissions and forward them to a designated email address.‚öôÔ∏è How to UseDownload: Save the code as an index.html file (or a more descriptive name like vendors.html).Open: Open the file in any modern web browser to view it locally.Deploy: Upload the single .html file to any static web hosting service (like GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).üîß CustomizationChanging the Form EndpointThe form is configured to send submissions to a specific Formspree URL.
